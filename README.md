# Auxiliary clojure library for common functions

This is a collection of functions mostly borrowed from other libraries
as
[suchwow](https://github.com/marick/suchwow/),
[clojure-commons](https://github.com/marick/clojure-commons)
and [hara](https://github.com/zcaudate/hara) to complete the namespace
of clojure core functions with intuitively named and easy to use
functions.

One particular requirement for this "auxiliary" collection is to avoid
adding further dependencies, hence the extraction of simple functions
from the aforementioned frameworks: here we take base functions
avoiding the proliferation of further dependencies.

## Usage

Insert into your project `:dependencies`:

```
[org.clojars.dyne/auxiliary "0.3.0-SNAPSHOT"]
```
